# EvolutionaryGaming

* main.py calls the main evolution algorithm. It can be given command line arguments: python3 main.py [random seed] [Atari game] [log filename]
* evolutionary_problem.py contains the functions required by the algorithm: generator, observer, evaluator, mutate, crossover
* function_set.py contains the function set.
* constants.py contains constants for the algorithm and the CGP programs.
* CGP_program.py contains the code of for a CGP program.
* CGP_cell.py contains the code for a cell in a CGP_program.
